# Companion dispisitions

When we want to add new NPC as a companion, we must define it in dispositions file. **It's very important to define our NPC when we wants to be supported as companion in mod**

```yaml
# content reference token (use it in content pack key or for loading in code with ContentLoader)
Data/CompanionDispositions

# Target file in mod assets folder (refered by token)
assets/Data/CompanionDispositions.json 
# Refered localized file
assets/Data/CompanionDispositions.<lang_code>.json
```

## Structure&Format

Definition structure is a dictionary of NPC, where key is NPC name and value represents companion definitions with slash splited sections.

```json
{
  "<NPC_name>": "<recruitable>/<skills>/<availability>/<minimum_hearts>/<price>/<sword>"
}
```

**Example:**

```json
{
  "Abigail": "recruitable/warrior//5/0/Abby's Planchette",
  "Maru": "recruitable/doctor fighter//5/0/Maru's Wrench",
  "Shane": "recruitable/fighter//5/0/-1",
  "Leah": "recruitable/forager fighter//5/0/Leah's Whittler",
  "Haley": "recruitable/fighter scared//5/0/Haley's Iron",
  "Emily": "recruitable/fighter//5/0/Rusty Sword",
  "Penny": "recruitable/forager fighter//5/0/Penny's Fryer",
  "Alex": "recruitable/warrior//5/0/Alex's Bat",
  "Sam": "recruitable/fighter//5/0/Sam's Old Guitar",
  "Sebastian": "recruitable/warrior//5/0/Seb's Lost Mace",
  "Elliott": "recruitable/fighter//5/0/Elliott's Pencil",
  "Harvey": "recruitable/doctor fighter//5/0/Harvey's Mallet"
}
```

## Companion definition

| availability | An [EPU](https://github.com/ChroniclerCherry/stardew-valley-mods/blob/master/ExpandedPreconditionsUtility/README.md) condition delimited with `;` | Say when the companion can be available for recruit (CSM state `AVAILABLE`), otherwise they are unavailable for recruit (CSM state `UNAVAILABLE`) and you can't ask them for follow (same behavior as non-companion standard NPCs). |
| minimum_hearts | NOT USED! | |

## Edit dispositions in content pack

File `assets/data/myOwnCompanionDispositions.json`:

```js
{
  "Biglydz": "recruitable/warrior//5/0/Master sword" // This companion uses custom sword from another mod named 'Master sword'
  "Hastings": "recruitable/warrior//5/0/40" // This companion uses vanilla sword with ID 40 (Abby's Planchette)
  "Pam": "recruitable/warrior//5/0/Cutlass" // This companion vanilla sword named 'Cutlass'
}
```

File `content.json`:

```json
{
  "Format": "1.3",
  "Changes": [
    {
      "Target": "Data/CompanionDispositions",
      "FromFile": "assets/data/myOwnCompanionDispositions.json"
    },
  ]
}
```

This defines new companion in mod. Referenced NPC must be exists in gam. If it's a Custom NPC, this NPC mod must be put in mod folder and loaded in game.
