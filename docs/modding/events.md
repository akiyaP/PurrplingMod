# Events

NPC Adventures events are loaded from data asset `Data/Events` (file `assets/Data/Events.json` in NA mod folder). Event content structure is ordinary string-string dictionary.

## Adventuring story events

Currently there are only one adventuring story event. It's Marlon's invitation event stored under key `adventureBegins`. **Please don't change or remove this event in your content packs**

## Companion cutscenes

Companion cutscenes are events which are played when you are entered to a location with recruited companion (during adventuring with currently recruited companion). The key of these kind of events ere more complex, the template is: `companion/<int:eventId>/<string:npcName>/<string:location>[/<epu_conditions> ...]`

The key always starts with `companion/` and follow these parameters:

| # | param name | type | description |
| --- | ---------- | ---- | -------------------------------- |
| 1 | eventId | int | SDV event id. Avoid conflict with another event ids. It's recommended prefix id with yout nexusmods mod id |
| 2 | npcName | string | An NPC name of recruited companion. Player must have recruited this companion to play this event |
| 3 | location | string | A location name for this event. Player must enter this location with recruited companion (defined in previous parameter) to play this event |
| 4 | epu_conditions | array of string splited by `/` | (optional) [Extended precondition utility](https://github.com/ChroniclerCherry/stardew-valley-mods/blob/master/ExpandedPreconditionsUtility/README.md) condition like `f Linus 1000/w rainy/z spring`

Internal event id standard (in NA development team) is:

<details>
  <summary>Companion event id standard</summary>
```
     Nexus mod id (4582 is NA's nexus id. For content packs use yours)
    /
   /    Number of companion in companion disposition file (entry index)
  /    /
4582 1n xx
     \   \ 
      \   Number of event for this companion
       \ 
        Event type: companion event (1)
```
</details>
